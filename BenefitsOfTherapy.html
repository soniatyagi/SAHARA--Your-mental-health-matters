            <p class="card-text">There are a variety of benefits associated with therapy. Each one will come in handy at different stages or periods of the process. When it’s all said and done, therapy is about self-betterment and self-improvement. If these are processes
                which you value, then you will certainly appreciate the following benefits.</p>
            <h5 class="card-title text-md-left font-weight-bold container" id="font"> Healthy Coping Mechanisms</h5>
            <p class="card-text text-left container">Feeling stressed out or overwhelmed is common in today’s world. The ability to cope and deal in a healthy, positive and constructive manner is often the difference between success and failure in life. A person who is unable to manage themselves
                when things get tough may have some hard times ahead of them.
                <br> Attending therapy can change this. By working with a licensed professional who specializes in helping others, you can learn healthy coping mechanisms which allow you to navigate the challenges of life without burning out or falling
                apart. As human beings, we all face challenges and tough times. Everyone can benefit from learning healthy coping mechanisms..
            </p>

            <h5 class="card-title text-md-left font-weight-bold container" id="font"> Overcoming Past Trauma</h5>
            <p class="card-text text-left container">If issues from the past are not dealt with, they can linger, fester, and adversely impact your day-to-day life. Overcoming past trauma is not always easy, but it’s something that you can do when you work with a therapist. Therapists have undergone
                extensive graduate-level education, training, and supervised work in order to learn and implement science-backed techniques to help you move through things.
                <br> Working through past trauma is not easy. It’s natural to feel hesitant or uneasy about discussing prior traumas and upsetting events. Certain issues going on in your present life may be the result of prior trauma, and by addressing
                that root cause, you may be better equipped to move forward. It will take time, but with your dedication and willingness with the help of your therapist, you will overcome.
            </p>

            <h5 class="card-title text-md-left font-weight-bold container" id="font"> A Sounding Board</h5>
            <p class="card-text text-left container">Loneliness is a problem many people face. Feeling isolated can often contribute to an already overwhelming situation. A strong support system can be helpful in facing the challenges life often presents, and without that system, in place, additional
                stress may be added to life.
                <br> This is when having a therapist in your corner can be so beneficial. The job of your therapist is to listen to you, ask appropriate questions, and then work with you to find solutions to the challenges you’re facing. Having someone
                to talk to, turn to, and confide in can make an amazing difference.
            </p>

            <h5 class="card-title text-md-left font-weight-bold container" id="font"> Improved Relationships</h5>
            <p class="card-text text-left container">When going to therapy, the relationships that you have with others are bound to come up. This is a good thing. Relationships share such an intimate tie with our quality of life and who we are as people. The right relationships can make us
                better people while the wrong relationships can wreak havoc and drag us down. In order to have the best quality of life, we need to enjoy positive, mutually beneficial relationships.
                <br> The benefits of therapy are not limited to your relationships with others, but also your relationship with yourself. This sets the tone for how you will interact with others. Furthermore, having a great relationship involves treating
                yourself kindly, taking care of yourself, pushing yourself to achieve your goals, and maintaining high levels of self-esteem.
                <br> Improving your relationships with others and yourself can take time, but this is an incredible benefit of working with a therapist.
            </p>

            <h5 class="card-title text-md-left font-weight-bold container" id="font"> Achievement Of Goals</h5>
            <p class="card-text text-left container">Throughout the process of therapy, your therapist is going to work with you and help you set certain goals which will be beneficial to you. Your therapist will also assist you on your journey of reaching and fulfilling these goals. This is
                a very impactful part of therapy which sets the precedent for what life will be like after your work with your therapist is complete. The ability to set goals and achieve them matters, not just in therapy, but in everyday life as well.
                <br> You will find that achieving goals will also contribute to your self-esteem. When you set a goal and accomplish it, you’re reinforcing to yourself that you’re capable. This increases confidence and makes you likelier to branch out
                and challenge yourself more often. This plays a pivotal role in living your best life and making the most of the opportunities which present themselves to you.
            </p>

            <h5 class="card-title text-md-left font-weight-bold container" id="font"> Purging Bad Habits</h5>
            <p class="card-text text-left container">When you work with a therapist, you have the opportunity to get rid of self-destructive habits. In many cases, therapy can greatly help you with this by providing various constructive alternatives. Bad habits tend to make adverse situations
                even worse than they already are. By getting rid of bad habits, you are already on the path to enjoying and experiencing a better quality of life.

                                <p class="card-text text-center" id="pfont">Talk therapy encourages open and honest dialogue about issues that cause you distress. Through your relationship with your therapist, you’ll work to identify and understand how these stressors are impacting your life, plus
                                    develop strategies to manage the symptoms.
                                    <br> If you’re still on the fence about the benefits of talk therapy, consider this: About 75 percent of people who participate in talk therapy experience some benefit, according to the American Psychological Association..

                                    <br> Unlike couples, family, or group therapy, individual therapy focuses solely on you. This allows for a deeper understanding of the issues and more time for developing coping strategies to help you handle difficult

                                    going to therapy allows couples to meet with a neutral party.
                                    <br> One of the foundational goals of couples therapy is learning how to improve interpersonal dynamics. A 2016 research reviewTrusted Source suggest that couples therapy is an effective treatment when a couple is experiencing
                                    individual and relational distress.

                                This process can often uncover uncomfortable emotions that can be addressed.
